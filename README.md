it is a stack of things (data) of images ,songs and main code which is to run the game named "ronaldo vs kutta" it is completely made by me and all the 118 lines are written by me and it is a fun game to play but unfortunately the feature of high score is coming in next version of it - 2.0 . The credit of teaching me python goes to the app programming hero ,the programiz app and youtube channel apna college. But the credit of teaching me pygame module goes to clear code youtube channel.it is made on january 2024.
Thank You
